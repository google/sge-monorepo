# How to Contribute

This project is a recopilation of the infrastructure work done by Google in
Stadia Games & Entertainment (SG&E). That organization was shutdown on 2021
and further development has stopped. This open source project is delivered
in an informative basis for any interested parties that might benefit from
studying, installing or modifying this code.

The above means that this project *is not under active development* and in all
probability will never be. That means that there is no guarantees that there
will be maintainers available to look into issues, pull requests or answer
overall questions.
