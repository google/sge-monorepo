# bazel2vs

## Overview

bazel2vs generates a Visual Studio solution and projects from bazel. It enable editing, building and
debugging C++ targets from Visual Studio.

Visual Studio uses `bazel build`. Modification of the compilation environment needs to be done
through bazel.

Full C++ debugging is supported. The debugger working directory is set to the location of the
executable generated by bazel.

## Usage

The bazel2vs executable can be found in `//bin/windows/bazel2vs.exe`

Usage: `bazel2vs <options><targets>`

bazel2vs generates a Visual Studio solution and Visual Studio projects for the targets specified
including all their dependencies. By default, the solution will be located under `//msbuild` and be
named `sge.sln`.

*   `-output_dir`: the output directory for the solution. Default is `\\msbuild`.
*   `-solution_name`: the name of the solution generated. Default is `sge`.
*   `<targets>` should always be the last arguments to the command.

## Requirements and Limitations

*   Visual Studio 2019 is required to debug C++ targets.
*   Currently, C++ and Rust targets on Windows and Linux are supported.
    Debugging is not supported on Linux.
